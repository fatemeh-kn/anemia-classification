## 📌 Project Overview

Anemia is a common blood disorder characterized by a lack of healthy red blood cells.  
Early and accurate detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.

In this project:
- A neural network model is trained to classify anemia
- Training and validation performance are evaluated across epochs
- Accuracy and loss curves are analyzed to assess model behavior

## 🧠 Model Features

- Deep Learning model built with **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Binary or multi-class classification (depending on dataset)
- Tracks:
  - Training Accuracy
  - Validation Accuracy
  - Training Loss
  - Validation Loss
  - Performance evaluated over multiple epochs

##📊 Results
The model achieves high validation accuracy

Loss curves indicate good convergence

Minor fluctuations in validation loss suggest realistic generalization behavior
